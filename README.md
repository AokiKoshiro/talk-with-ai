# Talk-with-AI

## Description
This is an application for talking with AI. The input voice is converted into text by Whisper, and then that text is used as the basis for GPT to generate a response. That response text is converted into voice through TTS (Text-to-Speech) and outputted. This allows you to have voice-based conversations with AI.

## Demo
You can try this app from [here](https://talk-with-ai.onrender.com/).
